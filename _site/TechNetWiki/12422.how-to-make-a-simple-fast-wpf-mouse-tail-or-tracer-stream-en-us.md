<br><br>This article shows how to add "Tracer" objects, that follow the mouse around in a stream / tracer effect.<br>  
  
<br>The concept is to move away from a "controller" type solution where a monitor loop adds and removes dots.  
  
<br>In this example, each dot is responsible for it's own actions, similar to how objects can group and swarm together, depending on their AI.

<br>In this screenshot, the black lines are just "mouse-down" drawn on the InkCanvas. The red line is the tracer line following and decaying behind the mouse.  
  
  

### The TracerAnt
  

classTracerAnt : Border

   {

       FrameworkElement myCanvas;

       Timer timer;



       publicTracerAnt(FrameworkElement parent,intdelay)

       {

           Width = Height = 2;

           Background = Brushes.Red;

           HorizontalAlignment = System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left;

           VerticalAlignment = System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Top;

           IsHitTestVisible =false;

           Point p = Mouse.GetPosition(myCanvas);

           Margin =new Thickness(p.X, p.Y, 0, 0);

           myCanvas = parent;

           timer =new Timer(selfControlledBorderTick,this, 0, delay);

       }



       voidselfControlledBorderTick(objectstate)

       {

           Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Send,new Action(() =>

           {

               Point p = Mouse.GetPosition(myCanvas);

               Margin =new Thickness(p.X, p.Y, 0, 0);

           }));

       }



       publicvoid Kill()

       {

           timer.Change(Timeout.Infinite, Timeout.Infinite);

       }

   }


When the timer ticks, it simply changes the margin to the mouse position (in relation to the container)



Note the use of the Application.Current.Dispatcher, a failsafe way to get back to the UI thread



Also note the Horizontal and VerticalAlignment set to left and top, as a centered or stretched control won;t be positioned the same as the mouse.


### On MouseEnter





privatevoid MyCanvas_MouseEnter(objectsender, MouseEventArgs e)

{

    AddAntTracers(numberOfAnts, millisecondsTillCheck);

}



privatevoid AddAntTracers(int count,int totalDelay)

{

    intgap = totalDelay / count;

  

    Task.Factory.StartNew(()=>

        {

            for(var a = 0; a < count; a++)

            {

                Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Send,new Action(() =>

                {

                    MyInkCanvas.Children.Add(newTracerAnt(MyInkCanvas, totalDelay));

                }));

                Thread.Sleep(gap);

            }

        });

}





AddAntTracers takes the total time between an ant tick/check and divides by the number of ants desired. this gives the interval between adding that means a perfect stream is produced.



You can play with the totalDelay and count to make the stream longer or shorter and the ants closer or father apart.



Notice also the use of .net4's Task class, a very powerful replacement for the BackgroundWorker, although you easily use a Background worker if you are still on .net 3.5

### On MouseLeave

privatevoid MyCanvas_MouseLeave(objectsender, MouseEventArgs e)

{

    Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Send,new Action(() =>

    {

        foreach(TracerAnt antinMyInkCanvas.Children)

            ant.Kill();



        MyInkCanvas.Children.Clear();

    }));

}
  
  

Finally, when the mouse leaves, the collection is removed.



**However, each TracerAnt still has an active timer, which may prevent tear-down and garbage recycling and a memory leak, so first itterate through each child and kill the timer.**



The Kill method shown in the TracerAnt snippet uses Timeout.Infinate for delay and interval, which kills the timer.
