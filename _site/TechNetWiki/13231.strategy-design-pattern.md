The Strategy (or Policy) pattern is a [design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13207.software-design-pattern.aspx), used in software engineering to define a family of actions or algorithms that can be selected depending on the object. It essentially keeps a set of pointers to functions and calls them depending on the<br> object requirements.  
  
  
<br>It is defined as a [behavioral design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13209.behavioural-design-pattern.aspx), because the actions depend on the object.

It allows conditional processing depending on run-time values.   
<br>The conditional processes themselves can be shared between classes, allowing reuse and abstraction of a function that can be altered without breaking the class that uses it.

A validation framework may choose which validation classes to use against an object, depending on it's type.
