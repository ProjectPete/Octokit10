## <a name="The_Problem"></a>The Problem
  
<br>I am trying to publish an MVC 4 website, including "out of the box" SimpleMembership.<br>  
  
<br>The problem arises when I simply try to add an existing or new entity model, for use in linq with web services, from the same website.  
  
<br>I have spent considerable time trying to add an existing edmx model to a new MVC site, even patching to EF6, which has a fix for multiple models, which eventually worked fine locally.   
  
<br>When I published my solution to Azure, it broke with no useful error information.  
  
  

## <a name="Initial_Setup"></a>Initial Setup
  
<br>Create an empty Azure database instance  
  
<br>Create an empty Azure website and link resources to the database  
  
<br>Create a new MVC4 project in Visual Studio 2012, leave default "Internet Application" template and "Razor" view engine.

[![ ](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/resized-image.ashx/__size/276x0/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/1373.Capture1.PNG)](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/1373.Capture1.PNG)  
  
<br>Here is the initial collapsed view of the solution, straight out of the box.  
  
<br>Below is the start of Web.config:  
  

<?xmlversion="1.0"encoding="utf-8"?>

<configuration>

  <configSections>

    <sectionname="entityFramework"

             type="System.Data.Entity.Internal.ConfigFile.EntityFrameworkSection,

             EntityFramework,Version=5.0.0.0,Culture=neutral,PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"

             requirePermission="false"/>

  </configSections>

  <connectionStrings>

    <addname="DefaultConnection"

         connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\v11.0;InitialCatalog=aspnet-MVC4_EF4-20131210000611;

         IntegratedSecurity=SSPI;AttachDBFilename=|DataDirectory|\aspnet-MVC4_EF4-20131210000611.mdf"

         providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>

  </connectionStrings>
  
<br>Now run this vanilla out-of-the-box project, with absolutely no changes.  
  
<br>It is **AccountController.cs** that has the [Authorise] and [InitializeSimpleMembership] attributes, so you have to navigate to the<br>**login page** to trigger the creation of the SimpleMembership schema in the database.  
  
<br>By default, the connection string creates a LocalDb database. and generates the tables and foreign key constraints in this new database.  
  
[![ ](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/resized-image.ashx/__size/345x0/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/8802.Capture2.PNG)](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/8802.Capture2.PNG)  
  
**That should all work fine on your local machine.**  
  
  

## <a name="Publish_to_Azure"></a>Publish to Azure
  
<br>Log back into Azure, select the new website, go to the "dashboard" tab and "Download the publish profile".  
  
<br>Back in Visual Studio, right-click the website and select "Publish" (or select menu option "Build" / "Publish *YourProjName*")  
  
<br>Import the publish profile you just downloaded.  
  
<br>Click Next to the "Settings" page and change the "UsersContext" (DefaultConnection) to use the Azure database that was resource linked, above.  
  
<br>Click "Finish" to publish it to Azure.  
**<br>This should also work fine. Go manage the Azure database and again you'll see the tables added to the empty database and registered users get added.**  
  
  

## <a name="Now_Add_EF4"></a>Now Add EF4
  
<br>This is where things start to go wrong.   
  
<br>Firstly, right-click the **Models folder**, Add / New Item / Data / "ADO.NET Entity Data Model", named whatever you like.  
  
<br>In the Entity Data Model Wizard, select "Generate from database" and on the next page<br>**select "DefaultConnection (Settings)**"  
  
**Uncheck "Save entity connection settings in Web.Config"**. This prevents a second connection string being used.<br>**I'm not sure the relevance of this yet.**  
  
<br>Click next, choose your preferred Entity Framework version, click next.  
  
<br>Firstly, if you did not select any objects and click Finish, after a warning, you would get an empty model. Again, this builds, runs locally and when republished to Azure.  
  
<br>However, we will include the five new Simple Membership tables, as shown below...  
  
[![ ](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/5432.Capture3.PNG)](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/5432.Capture3.PNG)  
  
<br>... then you get the first compilation errors:  
  
<br>"Error 1Missing partial modifier on declaration of type 'MVC4\_EF4.Models.UserProfile'; another partial declaration of this type existsc:\users\pedro\documents\visual studio 2012\Projects\MVC4\_EF4\MVC4\_EF4\Models\AccountModels.cs"  
  
<br>...and...  
  
<br>"Error 2Ambiguity between 'MVC4\_EF4.Models.UserProfile.UserName' and 'MVC4\_EF4.Models.UserProfile.UserName'c:\users\pedro\documents\visual studio 2012\Projects\MVC4\_EF4\MVC4\_EF4\Controllers\AccountController.cs"  


  
**UserProfile**and navigation property **UserName**are defined both by the "Code First" model for Simple Membership, and as a partial declaration by the new "tt" files from the EF "Database First" generated model. Because of the<br> folder we chose for the edmx, they also now clash with the namespace for the Account Model.  
  
  
  

## <a name="Fix_1_Remove_tt_files"></a>Fix - Remove tt files
  
<br>In the Models folder, as indicated by the error above, you will have noticed that the edmx creation wizard has created a .cs file for each table/class. These are created by the newly created tt template files in your project, shown below:  
  
[![ ](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/resized-image.ashx/__size/280x0/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/5460.Capture4.PNG)](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/5460.Capture4.PNG)  
  
<br>If you delete "**Model1.Context.tt**" and "**Model1.tt**" from your project, and recompile, it should now build without any conflicts.  
  
<br>Without those extra partial classes, the project will also run locally, and when published to Azure.  
  
  
  

## <a name="Move_the_Namespace"></a>Move the Namespace
  
<br>Now, delete Model1.edmx and create a new folder called "EF\_Data".   
  
<br>Repeat the steps above to recreate the edmx and supporting files in this new folder, which will therefore be a separate namespace from the Account Model.  
  
<br>This will now compile without the clashes above, however when you run the project you will now get a new error:  
  

privateclass SimpleMembershipInitializer

{

    publicSimpleMembershipInitializer()

    {

        Database.SetInitializer<UsersContext>(null);



        try

        {

            using(var context =newUsersContext())

            {

                if(!context.Database.Exists())

                {

                    // Create the SimpleMembership database without Entity Framework migration schema

                    ((IObjectContextAdapter)context).ObjectContext.CreateDatabase();

                }

            }



            WebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection("DefaultConnection","UserProfile","UserId","UserName", autoCreateTables:true);

        }

        catch(Exception ex)

        {

            thrownew InvalidOperationException("The ASP.NET Simple Membership database could not be initialized. For more information, please see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=256588", ex);

        }

    }

}
  
  
<br>If you put a breakpoint just before this, the actual exception is as follows:  
  
<br>"Schema specified is not valid. Errors:   
<br>The mapping of CLR type to EDM type is ambiguous because multiple CLR types match the EDM type 'UserProfile'. Previously found CLR type '**MVC4\_EF4.EF\_Data.UserProfile**', newly found CLR type '**MVC4\_EF4.Models.UserProfile**'."  
  
  
<br>This seems to be an age old problem with EF.   
[Here is a forum post discussing it](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/5a8ea003-c6bc-4fc6-ad2a-634f09447c49/ef4-mapping-of-clr-type-to-edm-type-is-ambiguous-error?forum=adodotnetentityframework).  
<br>It seems to be an issue with CreateObjectSet, which ignores namespaces. There are two solutions suggested, which may help you:  
  
<br>1) Manually rename one of the two clashing classes, making every class unique.  
<br>2) Separate them in different assemblies  
  
<br>Considering the simple steps I've taken to get to this point, neither of these options seem acceptable.   
  
  
  

## <a name="Fix_Rename_the_EF_entities"></a>Fix - Rename the EF entities
  
<br>Open the edmx in the Entity Data Model Designer.  
  
<br>Click the table headers and rename the table within the designer, like "UserProfile2", "webpages\_Roles2", etc.  
  
<br>This will now work fine, but you have to use the new entity names, which isn't a very clean solution.  
  
  
  

## <a name="Fix_Forget_the_Membership_tables_just_give_me_the_rest_of_the_database"></a>Fix - Forget the Membership tables, just give me the rest of the database
  
<br>In some cases, you don't want these tables in my data model and can leave them isolated to the Membership model.  
  
<br>You can have a separate user lookup table, which had your application specific columns and duplicated any important fields (like UserId and UserName).  
  
<br>Open the Entity Data Model Designer and delete the five Membership tables.  
  
<br>This will now run fine, without the schema errors.
