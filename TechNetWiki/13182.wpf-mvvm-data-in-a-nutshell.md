## <a name="The_Model"></a>The Model
  
<br>The Model in MVVM is usually just the class (business object). A "Person" class has properties and methods relating only to that class. This class is not usually responsible for persisting to database or file. The database layer is not really anything to do with the actual MVVM pattern, it's just part of the plumbing, so to speak.  
  

## <a name="The_ViewModel"></a>The ViewModel


The ViewModel uses the "database layer" to collect and present data (data of the object classes in Model). The returned data is held in public properties of the ViewModel, like (List<Person>) MyPersonel. A ListBox on your View can then bind to the ViewModel property, consume the data and two-way update it with no further code needed.






## <a name="The_Repository"></a>The Repository


The ViewModel could [for example] request data from a [Repository](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649690.aspx) (eg, a class in separate the "Repositories" folder). Then once the data is updated, you can use the same repository to same changes.



If you want full control, you can request the data and rebuild objects yourself, by hand. With some databases you have no choice. Here are a bunch of examples of connecting to an SQLite database, building objects and collections, saving back etc. All the usual database things you'd need for SQLite.

## <a name="DataAdapters"></a>DataAdapters


An alternative to this method is to use [SqlDataAdapter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter(v=vs.71).aspx)s, which bridge the gap. You then [load DataTable.DefaultView into your DataGrid](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/mydashboard?f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&f%5B0%5D.Value=datatable&x=0&y=0). Additions and changes are two-way bound back to the DataTable, and you use "adapter.Update()" to save the changes to the database.  
<br>


## <a name="Entity_Framework"></a>Entity Framework


The MS recommended way is to use [**Entity Framework**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716735.aspx). I HIGHLY recommend this method, as it generates the database layer and exposes the database as objects. A Person table is exposed as a "Persons" collection that you can add and remove to, then update to save.[Watch here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd776537.aspx).
