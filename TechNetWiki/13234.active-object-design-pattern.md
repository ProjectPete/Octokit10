The Active Object pattern is a [design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13207.software-design-pattern.aspx), used in software engineering to manage multiple concurrent processes on separate threads or even different machines.<br>  
<br>It does this my "decoupling the method from its invocation", meaning the method is triggered as the result of a scheduled message, through a queue, rather than directly.<br>  
  
<br>This pattern is asynchronous in execution.  
<br>First, a call is made to the **Proxy**, which is the only publicly visible part of the pattern.  
<br>The proxy makes the **Method Request**, which contains "context information" about the method.  
  
<br>This is passed to a **Scheduler**. The method is now decoupled and on the scheduler thread.   
<br>The scheduler decides which order to queue the Method Requests in the **Activation Queue**.  
<br>When the Scheduler picks up and executes a Method Request from the Activation Queue, it uses a<br>**Servant** to do the actual work.  
<br>Finally, a **Future** (or Callback) is used to receive the returning data.

This pattern enhances concurrency.   
<br>It also makes synchronised access to multi-threaded processes much simpler.
