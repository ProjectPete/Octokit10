The Null Object pattern is a [design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13207.software-design-pattern.aspx), used in software engineering, to provide a consistent return object in all circumstances. The assumption is that the "receiving" code processes a Null Object the same as it does for a normal object, however<br> there will be no action as a result. Null Objects are basically classes that do nothing, or contain only rudimentary information to handle the object, like an empty Person class acting only as a stub.<br>  
  
  
  
<br>It is defined as a [behavioral design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13209.behavioural-design-pattern.aspx), because the program continues to execute and process the data even if the only action is to "do nothing".

This allows the developer to add less "boiler-plating" like checking for null values and ensures program execution continues in all circumstances. Stubbing return data with a Null Object means the developer can get on with the code and come back and fill<br> in the details later. The developer can execute and test the application while working on layout considerations, then come back later to fill in some dummy data in a proper Person class.

In C#, implementing an Interface can lead to many new methods that need writing. If it is not the time to concentrate on such things, you may wish to return a null object, to at least allow the compiler to build.  
  
<br>If you needed to retrieve and perform actions on a user, you may retrieve that information from a database. However you do not know if all the fields are available, so you would have to check for null before using a property. However, returning a Null Object allows<br> code to just get on and use the property as it will at least be defined to it's default or initial state.
