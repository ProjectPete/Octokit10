# <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction


The "Chain of responsibility" pattern is a [design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13207.software-design-pattern.aspx), used in software engineering, to define the act of passing a piece of data down a chain of processors. Each processor decided whether to deal with the data or pass it straight on. A variation to this is<br> the "tree of responsibility", where each processor can itself also decide which direction to send the data.  
  
<br>It is defined as a [behavioral design pattern](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/13209.behavioural-design-pattern.aspx) because it affects what order the program acts on the data it is processing.


# <a name="Benefits"></a>Benefits


Benefits of this pattern are that data is processed in a timely, queued and organised way.<br>  
  
<br>This pattern also allows developers to easily add extra modules on the end of the chain, making the code more extensible.

An example of this pattern would be processing of a log message. Different level log messages may be dealt with differently. For example, the first processor may just write it to file, but a later processor (if the log message is high enough) could email<br> the message, or trigger an alert of some kind.  
  
<br>Another example is the collection of data for a report. A report class with an identifier could be passed through such a chain, each processor responsible for accessing its own stores, for information to add to the final report. As extra systems are added,<br> they too can be strapped on the end of the chain, providing extra information to the report class.
