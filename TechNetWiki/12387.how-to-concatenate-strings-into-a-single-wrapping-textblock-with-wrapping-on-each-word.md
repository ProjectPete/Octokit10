
**This "How To" shows several concepts around grouping and wrapping text.**  
  
<br>It also shows just how flexible the TextBlock now is, since the introduction of Runs. Each Run can have different styles, cursors, even events like MouseLeftButtonDown  
  
<br>For this scenario, a WPF Forum poster wanted to know how to wrap blocks of text into one group, to make a single paragraph. This project shows two methods in four examples, the WrapPanel and TextBlock Runs. Both are useful concepts to understand, as they each<br> have their uses.

**1)** Firstly an example of the WrapPanel, which is a great container, a very useful control:  
  

<WrapPanelMargin="10">

    <TextBlockMargin="0,0,4,0"Text="This is an example"/>

    <TextBlockMargin="0,0,4,0"Text="with textboxes that line up horizontally"/>

    <TextBlockMargin="0,0,4,0"Text="then wrap by TEXTBLOCK to a new"/>

    <TextBlockMargin="0,0,4,0"Text="line when there is no more space"/>

    <TextBlockMargin="0,0,4,0"Text="pull the window out to"/>

    <TextBlockMargin="0,0,4,0"Text="see it wrap and change"/>

</WrapPanel>
  

This will produce a bunch of textblocks that do not themselves wrap, and when there is no space, the TextBlock as a whole will jump to the next line.





**2)** Next here is an example of using the TextBlock.Inlines collection, by manually assigning Runs in XAML:
  
  

<TextBlockMargin="10"TextWrapping="Wrap"><RunText="This is an example"/><RunText=" of a group of"/><RunText=" manually coded runs"/><RunText=" which are parts of a textblock"/><RunText=" and this is probably closer to what you want"/></TextBlock>
  
  
<br>This does just what we want, joining the blocks together and breaking on words, not per block.  
  

**3)** Example three shows how to build the Runs programatically and add them to an existing TextBlock:
  

var texts =new List<string> {"This is an example of building a TextBlock"," programmatically from a collection"," of strings into one flexible wrapping TextBlock"};

 

foreach(var textintexts)

    tb1.Inlines.Add(newRun { Text = text });
  
**<br>4)** Finally here is an example of some of the flexibility of this technique, by making two very different Runs which act independantly within a single TextBlock which I create and add to the Visual Tree.  
  

var cm1 =new ContextMenu();

cm1.Items.Add(newMenuItem { Header ="Copy"});



var cm2 =new ContextMenu();

cm2.Items.Add(newMenuItem { Header ="Do something else"});





var run1 =new Run

{

    Text ="Hello",

    Background = Brushes.Yellow,

    Foreground = Brushes.Blue,

    Cursor = Cursors.Hand,

    ContextMenu = cm1,

    FlowDirection = System.Windows.FlowDirection.RightToLeft,

    FontFamily =new FontFamily("Courier"),

    FontSize = 20.0D,

    FontWeight = FontWeights.Bold,

    TextDecorations = TextDecorations.Strikethrough,

    ToolTip ="Run 1",

};

run1.MouseLeftButtonDown +=new MouseButtonEventHandler(run1_MouseLeftButtonDown);



var run2 =new Run

{

    Text =" World",

    Background = Brushes.LightGreen,

    Foreground = Brushes.Red,

    Cursor = Cursors.Cross,

    ContextMenu = cm2,

    FlowDirection = System.Windows.FlowDirection.LeftToRight,

    FontFamily =new FontFamily("Times New Roman"),

    FontSize = 30.0D,

    FontWeight = FontWeights.ExtraLight,

    TextDecorations = TextDecorations.Underline,

    ToolTip ="Run 2",

};

run2.MouseLeftButtonDown +=new MouseButtonEventHandler(run2_MouseLeftButtonDown);



var tb2 =new TextBlock { Margin =newThickness(10) };

tb2.Inlines.Add(run1);

tb2.Inlines.Add(run2);



sp1.Children.Add(tb2);
  
  
<br>In this example, as well as the visual differences, you can hover over EACH TEXT PART and see a different Cursor & Tooltip and even click each block to trigger separate events!
