XAML is one of the best ideas to come out of Microsoft for UI development. While many developers are turning to JavaScript and HTML5 for cross platform applications, WPF and Silverlight still dominate the LOB applications of most "bricks and mortar" companies.<br> Windows Phone and Windows 8 Apps extend the language to new frontiers, evolving XAML for the next generation.

- A Skype chat group where we can text chat to each other when needed.
- To keep the conversation going and develop a genuine community of active developers.<br>
